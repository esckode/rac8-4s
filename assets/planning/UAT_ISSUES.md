# UAT Issues — found during the 2026-07-20/21 AWS deploy session

Running tracker for defects surfaced while standing up and testing the first UAT
deploy (CloudFront `d37ruxd1gf48ip.cloudfront.net`, since torn down). Each issue is
scoped for a Sonnet implementer: symptom → verified root cause (`file:line`) → fix →
verify. Follow `CLAUDE.md` throughout — TDD (§4), one logical change per commit and
branch-per-issue (§11), surgical edits (§3). **Read the referenced code before editing;
several fixes have a "do NOT" note because the obvious approach is wrong.**

Severity: 🔴 blocks a user-facing feature · 🟠 real defect, limited blast radius · 🟡 robustness.

**Resolved issues are archived in [`COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md`](./COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md)** (CLAUDE.md
§12 — working the open queue shouldn't cost a read of every closed issue). The table below stays the
full index: resolved rows link into the archive, open rows link to a section in this file.

**No open issues right now** — ISSUE-1–21 and the 2026-07-26/27 walkthrough batch (ISSUE-22–31) are
all resolved; see [the walkthrough-queue summary](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#walkthrough-queue-2) for
the ship order and what each shipped. Number new issues from where the archive ends (32).

| # | Status | Severity | Title | Area |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [ISSUE-22](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-22) | ✅ Resolved | 🟡 | Login greets guests with "Welcome back."; page titles/descriptions end in full stops | frontend · copy |
| [ISSUE-23](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-23) | ✅ Resolved | 🟠 | Auth pages hardcode a 390×844 phone frame — clipped below 390, gutters above | frontend · layout |
| [ISSUE-24](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-24) | ✅ Resolved | 🟠 | An account with no linked player gets `TOKEN_INVALID` + "sign in again" — an unbreakable loop | api + frontend |
| [ISSUE-25](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-25) | ✅ Resolved | 🟡 | `seed-test-accounts.ts` creates accounts with no linked player — every seeded login hits ISSUE-24 | scripts · dev |
| [ISSUE-26](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-26) | ✅ Resolved | 🟠 | Bottom nav labels clip off-screen at every phone width (6 items don't fit under ~444px) | frontend · layout |
| [ISSUE-27](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-27) | ✅ Resolved | 🟡 | Dark entry vs light app is intentional — document the boundary; replace the emoji icons | frontend · design |
| [ISSUE-28](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-28) | ✅ Resolved | 🟠 | Nav: collapse Standings + Matches into one "Play" hub; four items | frontend + api |
| [ISSUE-29](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-29) | ✅ Resolved | 🟠 | Temporarily block public browse + public registration; keep both invite paths working | frontend + api |
| [ISSUE-30](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-30) | ✅ Resolved | 🔴 | `/tournament/:id` redirects to a **literal** unsubstituted path — group launch's payoff step is broken | frontend |

## Not yet triaged / follow-ups

- **SSE `/tournaments/:id/events` returns 403 on every tournament page** — observed live 2026-07-27
  on a group-launched casual tournament while signed in as a registered participant. Real-time
  updates are therefore dead on those pages. Not yet triaged: it may be a consequence of
  [ISSUE-31](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-31) (no groups exist, so there may be nothing to subscribe to) rather than an
  auth defect in its own right. **Re-check after ISSUE-31 lands** before filing it separately.
- **`POST /api/analytics/events` returns 401 for a registered player** — confirmed live 2026-07-27,
  on every authenticated page. This is the `analytics.ts:23` dual-auth gap already listed below, now
  observed rather than inferred: it fires on each page view, so every authenticated session logs a
  401 and no analytics are recorded for account holders.
- **The app has no support destination.** No `mailto:`, no `support@`, no `/support` route anywhere
  (verified 2026-07-27). `ServiceUnavailable.tsx:14` already tells users to "contact support" with
  nowhere to go, and [ISSUE-24](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-24) had to drop the same phrase from its copy for this reason.
  Either add a real destination or stop promising one — small, but it is currently a dead end at
  exactly the moments a user is already stuck.
- **Auth page titles are not headings.** `Login.tsx:186` renders its title as a styled `<div>`,
  as do `ForgotPassword.tsx` and `ResetPassword.tsx`; `Signup.tsx:260` and `Landing.tsx:45` use a
  real `<h1>`. A screen reader gets no page heading on three of the five auth screens. Noticed
  while scoping ISSUE-22 and deliberately left out of it (§3 — surgical); needs its own issue, and
  the fix is a shared page-header component rather than five hand-rolled titles, which would also
  give ISSUE-22's convention something to enforce it structurally. ISSUE-23's `.auth-shell` is the
  natural home for it — if all three land, do this one last so it builds on that shell.
- **`pages/DesignSpec.tsx` is dead code** — imported by no route, test, or module; it hand-mirrors
  `Landing.tsx`'s hero copy and has to be kept in sync manually (ISSUE-22 does exactly that).
  Flagged, not deleted (§3). Decide whether it still earns its place.
- Any routes ISSUE-1's audit turns up with the same strict-auth-where-dual-intended gap
  (add rows here, fix separately).
  - **`analytics.ts:23`** (`POST /events`) — direct `requirePlayerSessionAuth`, no
    dual-auth fallback. Same class as ISSUE-1: a registered-account JWT with a linked
    playerId would 401 here today. Low severity (analytics ingestion, not user-facing
    blocking UX) but same root cause — needs the same `resolvePlayerId`-style shim.
  - **`messages.ts`** — mixed: several routes already call both
    `requirePlayerSessionAuth` *and* `requireOrganizerAuth` (lines ~44/53, 127/136,
    173/182, 329/338), suggesting dual-auth was hand-rolled per-route rather than via a
    shared helper — worth confirming each actually falls back correctly (not just
    calls both for different purposes). Two bare `requirePlayerSessionAuth` calls with
    no organizer fallback at lines ~217, 234 — needs a closer read to tell whether
    those are intentionally guest-only.
  - **`tournaments.ts`** — has its own dual-auth helper (`resolveTournamentPlayer`,
    ~line 100) used in most player-scoped routes, but several routes still call
    `requirePlayerSessionAuth` directly with no fallback (lines ~367, 930, 1800, 1845,
    1924, 2015). Needs a case-by-case read: some may be intentionally guest-session-only
    (e.g. a magic-link-specific verify step), others may be the same missed-adoption gap.
  - `player.ts` and `auth.ts` already have their own dual-auth resolvers — no gap found.
- **Tournament lifecycle has no automatic status transitions** (surfaced by ISSUE-9) — **moved to
  `BACKLOG.md` § Deferred on 2026-07-27**, since its urgency came from stale tournaments lingering in
  Browse, and Browse is now blocked ([ISSUE-29](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-29)). Still a real correctness gap; the two
  notes below travel with it and must not be lost. Nothing moves a normal tournament off
  `registration_open` at its `registration_deadline`, or to `completed` when finished — the only
  auto-close sweep is for polls.
  - **If you build this, it must NOT clear pending partner claims** when it closes registration.
    That looks like an obvious thing to fold in and it silently destroys ISSUE-15 sub-decision 3 —
    a partner's right to accept, during `registration_closed`, an invite that was sent before the
    deadline (`partnerConfirmWindowOpen`, `tournaments.ts:128-131`). Claims are swept at group
    creation instead; see [ISSUE-21](COMPLETED_UAT_ISSUES.md#issue-21).
  - It is **orthogonal to ISSUE-21**, not a prerequisite: closing registration does not trigger
    group creation, so a lifecycle sweep would not resolve any claim. ISSUE-21 does not wait on it.
- **The full e2e sweep (§11's merge gate) cannot pass as configured** — observed 2026-07-23:
  `npm run test:e2e` produced **142 failures / 267 passed**, overwhelmingly
  `RATE_LIMITED` raised by the fixtures' own `POST /:id/register` calls. ISSUE-11's
  per-IP cap is 25 registrations / 15 min (`registerPerIpMaxAttempts`), and a 427-test
  both-browser sweep from one IP blows through it within the first few multi-player
  fixtures; everything after that fails to seed, which also explains the
  `action-card` / `assistant-message` "element not found" failures downstream. Confirmed
  environmental, not a code defect: with the API restarted (in-memory limiter cleared),
  `partner-requests.spec.ts` passes 3/3 and `tournament-discovery-registration.spec.ts`
  13/13, while re-running a batch large enough to exhaust the cap fails again. No
  override exists anywhere — not in `.env`, `.env.example`, `scripts/e2e-setup.js`, or
  `playwright.config.ts`. Fix is a test-environment override (e.g.
  `APP_LIMITS_RATE_LIMIT_REGISTER_PER_IP_MAX_ATTEMPTS` raised for dev/e2e, ideally set by
  `e2e-setup.js` so it can't be forgotten) — **not** loosening the production default,
  which is the ISSUE-11 defence. Until then §11's "full run before merging" is not a
  meaningful gate and per-spec runs are the real signal.
  - **⚠ `pkill -f "workspace=packages/api"` does not actually restart the server** — confirmed
    2026-07-28. `npm run dev --workspace=packages/api` spawns `tsx watch` as a grandchild process
    whose full command line is just `tsx watch src/server.ts`; the `npm`/`workspace=` string never
    appears in `ps`, so the pkill silently matches nothing and the "restarted" server is the same
    long-lived process with the same exhausted in-memory rate-limit counter. Over one long session
    this produced a stack of orphaned `tsx watch` processes, only one of which was ever actually
    bound to port 3001 and serving traffic. **Restart by killing whatever is actually bound to the
    port** — `fuser -k 3001/tcp`, or find the PID via `ss -ltnp | grep 3001` and `kill -9` it — then
    confirm the new process has a different PID before trusting a "fresh server" e2e run.
- Deliverability: UAT SES mail lands in Gmail **spam** (DMARC can't align from a
  `gmail.com` sender) — a known, owner-accepted trade-off, tracked in
  `UAT_PWA_LAUNCH.md` P0.6-SES, not a bug. The real fix is a verified domain (§2).
